### Simple Message
When doing outreach both to media and voters it's best to have a simple message and as few as possible. This is because your message is what you want voter to know you by so it needs to be **general and simple like *'Audit the government to make your tax dollars work better for you'* is going to be better then and entire list of policies** because you will end up in a situation like Senator Warren where she had to take a more detailed position on healthcare because of hers given slogan about have a policy for that.

### Keep On Message
Whether at the door or talking with the press keep on message this means give **simple and generic answer for any issue that isn't the one your running your campaign on** this means what state or national candidate/party is running on, but also by recognizing local efforts are already taking the lead in the area.

### Talking to voters
**Let lit talk focus on survey** when you are door knocking or phone banking keep to the survey because you want to be able to collect first party data as often as possible and maximize your voter contact numbers.

### Use contrast with your opponent
**Talk about how you are going to improve the community and the individual and draw contrast** between your message and their record/message
