### Voter File Is Key regardless of what campaign you do
The only thing you need to spend money on for a campaign is a voter file which can range by state and should be purchased by the campaign or party so you own the data long term and can build on it through out multiple elections to improve your targeting
### Issue campaign
Issue campaign can take a number of forms, but the most common are grassroots lobbying and ballot amendments.

### Ballot Amendments
Are similarly ran as Candidates campaigns but the campaign law might let 501(c)# get involved with more direct electioneering.

#### Grassroots Lobbying
Campaigns that full under this category are often the issue ads and social media efforts to raise awareness of a specific bill. The focus of these campaigns is to engage your active know voters while fundraising and expanding your list

Example Groups:
- Human Rights Campaign (HRC)
- Americans For Prosperity (AFP)

### Candidate campaign
These campaigns are self explanatory but are much more important to parties. This is because name ID is a key factor that will hold back first time candidates so the willingness to run for more then one campaign is key to success.

**Unless you are a true political talent or is already know within the community** you are going to have to focus on state legislative and other small elections where you can hit your metrics to at least look like a real campaign.
